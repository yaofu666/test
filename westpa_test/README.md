* This is the template west.cfg file for using the MABBinMapper in a two-dimensional progress coordinate WESTPA simulation. 
* Since the MABBinMapper has been integrated into the latest version of WESTPA, you can simply enable it by adjusting the bins section in your west.cfg. 
* The parameters of MABBinMapper depend on your simulation goals.
